5. Scatter over the semolina and salt. Place lid on firmly and give the pot 5 good shakes to rough up the potatoes. Leave lid on and set aside.
6. Wait for the oven to come to temperature, the oil should be hot enough by then - test by putting in pinch of potato - ready when it sizzles straight away
